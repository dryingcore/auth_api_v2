# Auth4ALL

Is a simple authentication API made with TypeScript and Fastify to exercise the concepts of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/), also to pratice the concepts behind tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

This API is based on my other repository: [Auth_API](https://github.com/dryingcore/auth_api).

The plans are to host **AUTH4ALL** on my Virtual Private Server (VPS) and use it on future projects.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

Also don't forget you need a MongoDB Atlas account (or a instance on your local machine) to run this project, see [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Check .env.example for more information about the environment variables you need to set.
